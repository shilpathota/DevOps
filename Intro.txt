DevOps:
  Practices, Tools and Philosophies together as a whole to achieve the organization's ability to deliver applications at a high speed.
 - In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle.
 - These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow.
 - They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. 
 - These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a teamâ€™s velocity.
